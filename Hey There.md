# Calm down, don't get overwhelmed

This was made by Paragon to help you <u>streamline</u> the process of *starting* to use obsidian and all its features for study/work/managing yourself for whatever reason you choose to ~~(like me bothering you into it)~~.

>Obsidian is *life changer* for me because I'm not using it the way I've used any other note taking or productivity app. It's like a personal wiki / scrapbook for my life.
>
>My advice for someone who feels overwhelmed would be to choose **one** small area of your life that you want to *remember or organize*. For me, it started with my camping trips. I created three different sets of notes - one for my camping trips, one for state and national parks, and one for campgrounds. Starting with the most recent, I **made a note** for each of the camping trips I've taken in the past three years. I **linked** each trip to the parks and campgrounds we stayed in. Then I grabbed maps from each of the campgrounds.
>
>Now I've got a wonderful scrapbook of all my trips, I have a *place* to *keep track* of **learnings** for future trips, and I've got a *quick place to reference* all the sites at a particular campground when I'm booking my next trip.
>
><u>Do this for any part of your life</u>. Other parts of my life include my kids sports worlds, their school, my woodworking projects and tools, tech, etc.
>
>**Do NOT start** with plugins. **Add them** as you find you **need** them.

# Continuing with Obsidian
Done with those? Great! but if not **don't worry** about it, like all good habits using obsidian for notes takes time, consistency and practice and if this *isn't* the tool for you? **Thats okay**, <u>the point is to take notes and to track information</u> maybe notion, one note or something else entirely suits **your needs** better.  

>[!tip] If you are stuck at any point or have a doubt email me at `beastchappal@outlook.com`, please contact me if you spot any errors

This is a <font color="#2DC26B">seed</font>, you have to do a lot to reap its **rewards**, but if you use this <u>tool</u> well, if you realize what you need and are *consistent* you'll **achieve** your goals in study/work/managing yourself

If you feel like exploring further I suggest you go through [this link](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/14-example-vaults-from-around-the-web-kepano-nick-milo-the-sweet-setup-and-more/81788) however it is fairly advanced and quite a hill to overcome at times

>[!example] Further Goals
>- [ ] Go through `Hotkeys` in settings
>- [ ] Learn from others online
>- [ ] Go through settings for your extensions
>- [ ] Explore more extensions
>- [ ] There is a file called obsidianhome.html that I like to set as my browser homepage, open it in your browser, copy link and set it as `Homepage` in `Web Viewer` 
>- [ ] Pat your back, you've done something amazing
